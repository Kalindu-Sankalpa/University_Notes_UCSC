#Lesson-Plan 

>[!Goals]
>The goal of this course is to provide a comprehensive understanding of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**, specifically focusing on the efficient organization, storage, and manipulation of data within a computer. It bridges the gap between theoretical algorithm design and practical implementation in C, ensuring that data is handled in ways that optimize memory utilization and processing speed.

# Learning Objectives

- **Defining and Categorizing Data Structures:** Distinguish between **linear** (arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists) and **non-linear** (trees, graphs) structures.

- **Developing Efficient Algorithms:** Write well-defined, finite, and effective **pseudo-code and algorithms** to solve computational problems.

- **Mastering Memory Management:** Utilize **dynamic memory allocation** functions in C, such as `malloc()`, `calloc()`, and `free()`, to manage data at runtime.

- **Implementing Abstract Data Types (ADTs):** Understand and code the fundamental operations for **Stacks (LIFO)** and **Queues (FIFO)**, including handling overflow and underflow conditions.

- **Manipulating Linked Lists:** Create and manage various list types—including **singly, doubly, circular, and header linked lists**—through insertion, deletion, and traversal.

- **Solving Complex Problems:** Apply structures to real-world applications such as **polynomial representation**, **mathematical expression evaluation**, and recursive puzzles like the **Towers of Hanoi**.

# Topic Covered

1. [[Introduction & Arrays]]
	- Definitions of data structures and their importance in Computer Science.
	- Qualities of a good algorithm and the use of flowcharts/pseudo-code.
	- **Array properties**: Finite, ordered, and homogeneous collections.
	- Basic array operations: Traversing, inserting, deleting, searching, sorting, and merging.

2. [[Stacks]]
	- The **LIFO (Last-In, First-Out)** principle and the Stack ADT.
	- Core operations: `Push`, `Pop`, `Peek`, `isEmpty`, and `isFull`.
	- **Stack applications**: Reversing lists, checking for balanced parentheses, and converting arithmetic expressions (Infix, Post-fix, Prefix).
	- Recursive solutions using stacks, specifically for the **Towers of Hanoi**.

3. [[Queues]]
	- The **FIFO (First-In, First-Out)** principle and Queue ADT.
	- Linear queue implementation and the logic for `Enqueue` and `Dequeue`.
	- **Circular Queues**: Overcoming the limitations of linear queues regarding memory gaps.
	- **Priority Queues and Heaps**: Using binary trees (heaps) to manage elements by priority and performing **Heap Sort**.

4. [[Link Lists & Double Link Lists]]
	- Comparison between arrays and linked lists (fixed vs. dynamic size).
	- **Dynamic memory management** in C using pointers and heap memory.
	- **Singly Linked List** structure: Data fields and "next" pointers.
	- Basic list operations: Creating nodes, building a list of 'n' nodes, traversing, and searching.
	- Advanced operations: Deleting nodes from the beginning, end, or after a specific node.
	- **Doubly Linked Lists**: Two-way navigation using "next" and "prev" pointers.
	- **Circular and Header Linked Lists**: Lists where the last node points back to the start or lists containing a special header node.
	- Practical application: Representing **polynomials** using linked lists for mathematical operations.

5. [[Trees]]
	- **Defining and applying tree terminology**, such as root, leaf node, ancestor, descendant, level number, degree, height, and depth.
	- **Distinguishing between tree types**, including general trees, binary trees, full binary trees, and complete binary trees.
	- **Implementing memory representations**, specifically comparing sequential (array-based) and linked representations for binary trees.
	- **Mastering traversal algorithms**, including depth-first schemes (Pre-order, In-order, Post-order) and breadth-first schemes (Level-order).
	- **Constructing and manipulating Binary Search Trees (BSTs)**, including performing search, insertion, and complex deletion operations.
	- **Understanding self-balancing structures**, specifically the AVL tree balance property and the use of single and double rotations to correct imbalances.
	- **Utilizing trees for practical applications**, such as calculating the size/height of a tree, building expression trees for mathematical evaluation, and creating dictionary structures.

6. [[Sorting Methods]]
	- **1. Basic Sorting Techniques (Part A)**
		- **Selection Sort:** Finds the smallest element and exchanges it with the first position, repeating for the rest of the array.
		- **Insertion Sort:** Builds the sorted list one item at a time by comparing and inserting elements into their proper place.
		- **Bubble Sort (Sorting by Exchange):** Repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
	- **2. Advanced Comparison-Based Sorting (Parts B, C, and D)**
		- **Merge Sort:** A "divide and conquer" algorithm that recursively divides the array into halves, sorts them, and merges them back together.
		- **Shell Sort:** An improvement over insertion sort that allows for the exchange of elements that are far apart using a "gap" or increment.
		- **Quick Sort:** Another "divide and conquer" method that partitions the array around a selected "pivot" element.
		- **Heap Sort:** Utilizes a **Heap** data structure (a special binary tree where parents are ≥ children) to sort elements efficiently.
	- **3. Non-Comparison-Based Sorting (Part E)**
		- **Counting Sort:** Efficient when the range of input values is small; it counts the frequency of each distinct element.
		- **Radix Sort:** A linear sorting algorithm for integers that processes data digit-by-digit, starting from the least significant digit.
		- **Bucket Sort:** Distributes elements into various "buckets," sorts each bucket individually, and then concatenates the results.
	- **Factors Considered in Sorting**
	  The lecture also emphasizes important performance metrics for these algorithms:
		- **Speed:** Simple algorithms are typically $O(N^2)$, while advanced ones are $O(N\log{N})$.
		- **Storage:** Some algorithms sort "in place" $(O(N) memory)$, while others require extra space.
		- **Stability:** Whether the algorithm preserves the relative order of records with equal keys.
7. Complexity and Analysis of Algorythems
		This section moves from implementing data structures to mathematicaly evaluating how well they perform.

# Analogy for Understanding:

Think of these data structures as different ways to organize a **library**. An **array** is like a shelf of books where every slot is numbered; it's easy to find book #10, but if you want to squeeze a new book in the middle, you have to move every other book down. A **linked list** is more like a **scavenger hunt**: each clue (node) tells you where the next clue is. You can easily add a new clue anywhere by just updating the directions, but you have to start at the beginning to find anything at the end.
